## 🔒 Repository Scope & Access

This repository is designed as a **technical showcase** to demonstrate the architecture and logic behind the system. Please note the following regarding the source files:

* **Workflow Logic:** The n8n workflows are provided in a **read-only/reference format** (such as high-resolution screenshots or redacted JSON). Direct, "ready-made" import files are not included to prevent unauthorized duplication of the production logic.
* **Frontend & Web Interfaces:** The associated web dashboards and frontend interfaces mentioned in the documentation are hosted privately and are not part of this public repository.
* **Educational Purpose:** The primary goal of this repo is to provide a high-level understanding.

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidance

If you are looking to build a similar system based on this architecture:
1. Use the **Workflow Logic** section below to understand the node-to-node data flow.
2. Reconstruct the triggers and actions within your own n8n instance.
3. Ensure you have your own API credentials for the services listed in the **Tech Stack**.
